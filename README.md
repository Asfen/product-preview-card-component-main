## Overview

This was completely new this to me. I did a lot of googling. After much trail and error I am somewhat satisfied with the result. I hope in near future when I look back I would have grown so much that this thing would seem a simple task. I did a lot of media query to keep the image and the article same height.

### The challenge

Having 2 image and only displaying took a bit of time to get right.
The image and the article got different height as the width of the viewpost changed.
I cant yet figure out how to get it working while keeping the width ratio same.
I had to keep track of what was parent and what was direct child. Mix of flex and grid didnt help I guess.
My desktop viewport couldnt go below 500px which made correcting the mistakes at low resolution only possible after deploying.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- VS codes for code editing
- github and netlify for hosting the solution.

### What I learned

I learned to use @media query to change setting for more responsive page. Having 2 image and only displaying one as required was also a new concept to me. First time i actually used psuedo class and seemed very easy with hsl colors.
